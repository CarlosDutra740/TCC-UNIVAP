## 💧 Sistema Microcontrolado para Monitoramento do Consumo de Água  

### 📄 Abstract  

Leaks and poor management due to inadequately designed installations can lead to significant water waste — a resource that is increasingly scarce and valuable.  

This project proposes a **microcontroller-based system** that integrates **instrumentation, telemetry, and Internet of Things (IoT) communication** to monitor and optimize water consumption.  

By detecting anomalies and sending alerts to the user through a smartphone application, the system reduces not only financial losses but also structural damage to buildings (such as mold, damaged ceilings, painting deterioration, and finishes).  

Although not the primary focus, this solution can also be extended to monitor and control monthly water consumption if desired by the user.  

The correct application of these technologies helps mitigate or even eliminate waste, promoting more efficient resource management and contributing to the preservation of the environment.  

**Keywords:** water use optimization, waste reduction, IoT, telemetry, environmental preservation
